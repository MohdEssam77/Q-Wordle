# Q-Wordle
This was a project in Programming 2 course at Saarland University by Prof. Sebastian Hack and Prof. Jorge Hoffmann.

Wordle is a game similar to Mastermind. The goal is to guess a word in as few attempts as possible. For each guess, feedback is provided on which characters are correct and at the correct position (marked in green), which characters occur in the final word but at another position (marked in yellow), and which characters do not occur in the final word (marked in gray). It also supports Quantum Wordle (putting a quantum twist on the game).
